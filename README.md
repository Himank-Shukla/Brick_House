includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables,
navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript
plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.

CONNECTIVITY
We need our MySQL server address (if the database is on the same server as the web
server it will most likely be localhost or 127.0.0.1), username, password and database
name. Create a filename.php file and open and close the php code with tags before the
html, we can put regular html after it. Open the file in a browser and we should be able to
see nothing apart
from the title tag, if we could see the error in username/password or
database name which means there is something wrong.
// Create connection
<?php
$conn=mysqli_connect("localhost","root","","pms")
Or die(m ysqli_error($conn));
?>
